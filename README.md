HTML5 Audio Demos
======================

This is a demo showing usage of using [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) to load various
HTML audio libaries. It also demonstrates the capabilities of each library to handle 
playing a sound file multiple times. 

This project started out as an example of loading [SoundJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/SoundJS) using require.js. It has
evolved to include other sound libraries such as [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/).

Why? 
----

Sound in HTML5 games is generally pretty crappy. Support varies widely per browser
with different file formats, capabilites, etc.
